            I am a software developer who loves to bring ideas to life through
            programming.
          </p>
          <p>
          I'm a software engineer with a degree in computer science, driven by a passion for problem-solving and a love for technology. 
          My coding journey began in my first year, more as a hobby than a career focus. 
          After completing my college education in IT and continuing to pursue this hobby, 
          I realized that software engineering was my true calling. Since then, 
          I've worked on numerous projects and collaborated with experienced developers, 
          all of which have enriched my journey in this ever-evolving field.
